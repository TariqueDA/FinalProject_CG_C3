# Enhancing Customer Retention through Churn Analysis in Telecom (Final Year School Project)

# Overview
This final year school project focuses on the critical objective of analysing customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Customer attrition is a significant concern for telecom companies, and this project delves into understanding the factors that drive churn and devising targeted strategies to enhance customer retention.

# Course Goal
The project aligns with the course goal, C3, which emphasizes the ability to process and analyze data in a manner that leads to continuous learning and professional development.

# Introduction and Telecom Data Analysis

Anticipating and minimizing customer attrition is essential for telecom companies to maintain a loyal customer base. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This analysis involves studying various customer attributes, such as demographic details, account-related data, and service utilization specifics. The goal is to derive data-driven solutions that effectively reduce churn, leading to increased customer satisfaction and higher corporate revenue.

# Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project comprises nineteen columns representing independent variables that describe customer attributes for a fictitious telecommunications firm. The analysis primarily focuses on establishing the correlation between customer attributes and churn occurrences. The dataset is openly sourced and obtained from this link.

# Project Steps
The project is structured into the following key sections:

1. Data Reading
2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning
3. Data Visualization
   
# Potential Further ML Study Road Map
1. Feature Importance: Exploring Linear and Nonlinear Relationships
2. Feature Engineering: Encoding Categorical Attributes into Numerical Labels for Model Training
3. Setting a Baseline: Using the non-churn rate as a performance benchmark
4. Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets
5. Assessing Multiple Algorithms and Algorithm Selection: Gradient Boosting
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Model Performance Evaluation
